# 🚧 [TEMPORARY] ML & Data Layer Documentation

This file serves as a temporary guide documenting the core machine learning, rules, and data generation layers of the Limier AML Agent. These files form the backbone of the transaction analysis system.

## 1. Synthetic Data Generator
**File**: `backend/src/data/generate_synthetic.py`

**Purpose**: Generates highly realistic transaction and customer datasets at runtime to train and evaluate the ML/rules layers. The dataset comprises 2,000 customers.
**How it was created**:
- **Background Noise & Realism**: Simulates "boring" real-world transactions for ~90-95% of users to prevent the model from overfitting to pure noise. Key realism factors implemented:
  - **Log-normal Distributions**: Transaction amounts are drawn from a log-normal distribution, mimicking the heavy-tailed reality of finance where most transactions are small but a few are very large.
  - **Poisson Timing Processes**: The arrival times of transactions are modeled as a Poisson process tailored to the customer segment (retail vs business), ensuring organic gaps and bursts of activity rather than uniform spacing.
  - **Repeat Counterparty Pools**: Instead of randomizing counterparties every time, customers transact with a stable pool of repeat counterparties (e.g. paying rent, groceries, salaries) with an 80% stickiness rate, injecting realistic network behavior.
  - **Time-of-day Biases**: Transactions are explicitly biased towards business hours (9 AM - 6 PM) to simulate organic human activity.
  - **Geographic Anchoring**: The vast majority of activity is domestic (US) with a small, organic long-tail of legitimate cross-border transactions to common corridors (GB, CA, DE, etc.).
- **Typology Injection**: For the remaining small fraction of users, it injects strictly controlled, labeled AML typologies (e.g., structuring, rapid cash-out, round-trip layering, dormant-then-active, high-risk geography).
- **Ground Truth**: It embeds `is_planted_suspicious` and `planted_pattern` columns strictly for evaluation (never used as input features) so that model performance can be measured objectively.

## 2. Rules Engine
**File**: `backend/src/models/rules_engine.py`

**Purpose**: Implements deterministic, hand-coded AML rules that provide immediate and explainable flags for suspicious activity.
**How it was created**:
- **Pure Functions**: Each rule (e.g., `rule_structuring`, `rule_velocity_spike`) is built as a pure, independent function. This allows the AI orchestrator to call specific rules in isolation without evaluating the entire suite.
- **Config-Driven Design**: All thresholds (e.g., $9,000 for structuring, 70% for rapid cash-out) are stripped from the code and maintained centrally in the `RULES_CONFIG` dictionary. This makes the logic tunable and defensible.
- **Explainability**: Rules return a structured `RuleResult` containing human-readable reasoning and the specific `transaction_id`s that triggered the flag.

## 3. Feature Builder
**File**: `backend/src/features/feature_builder.py`

**Purpose**: Transforms raw transaction logs into dense, point-in-time features for the machine learning models.
**How it was created**:
- **Scope**: Focuses heavily on three critical areas: Amount & Structuring (Category A), Frequency & Velocity (Category B), and Cash-flow & Directionality (Category C).
- **High Performance**: Built utilizing vectorized operations and Pandas `rolling` windows. It pre-sorts the data by `customer_id` and `timestamp` to calculate features in a single, highly efficient pass across the entire dataset.
- **Target Leakage Prevention**: All features are computed strictly "point-in-time" prior to or exactly at the current transaction timestamp. It does not look into the future, ensuring ML models can be trained safely.
- **Robustness**: Includes edge-case handling for customers with missing history (filling NaNs with zeroes) and avoids division-by-zero errors when calculating ratios (like spike ratios and burstiness). Similar to the rules engine, thresholds and window sizes are centralized in `FEATURE_CONFIG`.

## 4. Machine Learning & Explainable AI
**File**: `backend/src/models/ml_models.py`

**Purpose**: Provides advanced predictive capabilities to catch zero-day anomalies and learn from historical ground truth.
**How it was created**:
- **Isolation Forest (Unsupervised)**: Detects generalized weirdness (zero-day typologies) by isolating anomalous points in the dense feature space. 
- **XGBoost (Supervised)**: Trains dynamically on the labeled synthetic data to catch exact mathematical correlations for structuring, cash-outs, and round-trips.
- **SHAP (Explainable AI)**: Injects `shap.TreeExplainer` into the XGBoost pipeline to extract the top feature importances driving a specific anomaly score. This ensures the ML layer is never a "black box" and can be explained natively by the AI Agent.

## 5. Hybrid Scorer (Orchestration)
**File**: `backend/src/models/hybrid_scorer.py`

**Purpose**: The central brain that unifies heuristic rules, unsupervised ML, and supervised ML into a single risk output.
**How it was created**:
- **50/50 ML Split**: Combines the Isolation Forest score (50% weight) and XGBoost score (50% weight) into a base anomaly risk rating (0-100).
- **Rule Override**: If a deterministic heuristic rule fires (e.g. strict Structuring limits breached), the customer is instantly elevated to "High Risk", completely overriding any nuanced ML uncertainty.
- **Noise Filtering**: It explicitly pre-filters the dataset for "material" transactions (e.g., >$8000) before evaluating rules, preventing 180-day micro-transaction noise from triggering false positives.

## 6. FastAPI Server & Agent Tools
**File**: `backend/src/api/main.py`

**Purpose**: Exposes the entire pipeline for real-time inference by the LLM Agent or Frontend UI.
**How it was created**:
- Wraps `anomaly_detection_tool.py` and `risk_classification_tool.py` behind a fast, asynchronous `/score` POST endpoint.
- Ingests raw JSON transactions, builds features, orchestrates the ML/rules, and returns a clean risk payload containing the final score, risk tier, triggered heuristic rules, and top SHAP features for the Agent to explain.
